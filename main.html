	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the run time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is. Efficient algorithms have a lower time complexity, meaning they take less time to complete even as input size increases.
    </p>
	 <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs in relation to the size of the input data. It is usually expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with low space complexity are often more memory efficient.
